This repository hosts the COA Task Force Take Home Challenge, encompassing an Interactive Photo Gallery task and various JavaScript coding tasks. To access and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Git repository by pasting the command "https://github.com/Son-Of-Christ/COA-Challenge" into your terminal (Linux) or command prompt/power shell (Windows).
2. Open the COA_TASK_FORCE_TAKE_HOME_CHALLENGE folder.
3. Navigate to the Interactive_Photo_Gallery folder and open the index.html file to participate in the gallery challenge.
4. Access the coding-challenge directory to engage with the JavaScript challenges.
5. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system to execute these challenges. If not, download and install it from "https://nodejs.org/".

To view the challenge outputs, run the following commands in your terminal:

1. "node arrayMap.js"
2. "node stringTransform.js"

Alternatively, if you prefer not to install Node.js or lack it, you can utilize an online compiler like https://onecompiler.com/javascript. Simply copy your JavaScript code and run it directly within this environment. God Bless You!!
